We can frequently see ads like "Machine Learning/Data Science with no Math". Ok, in theory you can work in the area with just high school math, but you will be stuck soon and will not be able to solve real world problems if you don't know the necessary math techniques to develop you own hypotheses, ideas, code, etc. In other, words you will always be an entry level data scientist if you run away from learn algebra, calculus, probability/statistics and maybe even differential geometry (ok, this may be too much).

This section is dedicated for mathematics, mainly in the scope of machine learning.
