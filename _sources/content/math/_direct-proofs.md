**Proposition**: If $x$ is an even integer, then $x^{2}$ is even.

````{prf:proof}
Suppose $x$ is an even integer, then by definition of even number $x=2a$, where $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. So, $x^{2}=\left(2a \right)^{2} = 2(2a^{2})=2b$, where $b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $x^{2}$ is even by definition of even number.
